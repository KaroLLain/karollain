# Happy to see you here!
⭐ Still new in the world of coding, still learning, but coding and creating web apps brings me a lot of fun! 
I'm very enthusiastic about bugs - those are great opportunity to learn :) ⭐

# About me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and TypeScript
- 💬 Ask me about anything - happy to help :)
- ⚡ Fun fact: in polish 'Code' is 'Kod', which is dangerously similar to 'Kot' ('Cat') 🐈, and I have two of them.
